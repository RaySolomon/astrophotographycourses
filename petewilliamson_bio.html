                          embarked on his astronomical journey in 1967 when he
                          started Hagley RC Secondary School and noticed an
                          observatory in a garden near the school playing fields
                          in the village of Churchill Worcestershire. The
                          observatory was owned by Mr Brian Manning a noted
                          discoverer of asteroids, who then took Pete under his
                          wing. <br />
                          <br />
                          He joined the Kidderminster Astronomical Society where
                          he had to a travel 46 miles round trip by bus to the
                          meetings. He got his first telescope when he was 11
                          years old and at aged 12 he went on to build his own
                          6” reflector.  After leaving school 1973 he continued
                          with astronomy and became quite proficient in the art
                          of Astro Photography using hypered film and dark room
                          techniques. <br />
                          <br />
                          A move to the dark skies of rural Shropshire in 1989
                          meant that astronomy was high on the agenda once
                          again. He was the founder of The Shropshire
                          Astronomical Society and was elected at Fellow of the
                          Royal Astronomical Society in 1994. In 2012 Pete began
                          studying astronomy at UCLAN and Liverpool John Moors
                          University. <br />
                          <br />
                          Pete presents BBC Radio Shropshire’s Eye on the Sky
                          radio show every month. He does solar imaging and also
                          deep sky imaging with robotic telescope networks and
                          has had image published in major astronomical journals
                          and books around the world. He is the Deep Sky Imaging
                          consultant with the <a href="http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/">Faulkes
