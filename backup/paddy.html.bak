                        can be a daunting exercise for the beginner. Even for
                        the more experienced learning technical software and
                        keeping up with new features can be a challenge. Of
                        course, we have all hit that wall unsure of why you
                        can't get to the level you desire or struggling to find
                        a way to take the next step. <br />
                        <br />
                        In this course I will walk through and end to end
                        example of an image highlighting the important areas and
                        approaches that I feel can help every image processor. <br />
                        <br />
                        During the example I will cover, to name but a few the
                        following keys topics.<br />
