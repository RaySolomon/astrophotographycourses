                        Mary McIntyre has had a lifelong passion for astronomy.
                        In 2011 she completed the Astronomy GCSE course, and in

                        Astronomy and Planetary Science. She has been doing
                        astrophotography for about 8 years and loves to
                        photograph just about anything that is in the sky! In
                        her spare time she runs the UK Women in Astronomy
                        Network, and writes astronomy blogs and articles for
                        several online magazines and her own blog page. Her

                        Magazine, and has also had one of her photographs used
