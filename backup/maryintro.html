                        covers using compact, bridge &amp; DSLR cameras, and
                        photographing with a wide angle or zoom lens and at the
                        telescope. <br />
                        <br />
                        Mary starts with wide field photography of
                        Constellations, The Milky Way, Star trails, Aurora,
                        Noctilucent clouds, Meteors, Satellite passes &amp;
                        Iridium flares. Then she moves on to discuss photography
                        with a zoom lens, including the Moon, star clusters and
                        deep sky objects. She also covers photographing objects
                        through a telescope, including afocal photography with a
                        compact camera and bridge camera, and prime focus
                        photography with a DSLR and T-ring &amp; adpater. Mary
                        will show you how to image the Moon, the Sun, and deep
                        sky objects through a telescope.
                        <p></p>
                        Mary will also cover the basics of image processing,
                        with both the simple Windows photo editing software and
                        paid-for tools like Lightroom to show the difference it
                        can make to a simple image.Â  Finally Mary will provide
                        an introduction to stackingÂ  - don't worry, its not as
                        difficult as it sounds!
