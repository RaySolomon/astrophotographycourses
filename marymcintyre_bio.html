                        McIntyre has had a lifelong passion for astronomy. She
                        first saw Saturn as a young child, and has been
                        fascinated by the night sky ever since, declaring at age
                        six that one day she would be an astronaut! Sadly this
                        was not to be but in 2011 she completed the Astronomy
                        GCSE course, and in 2014 she completed the Open
                        University Certificate in Astronomy and Planetary
                        Science. <br />
                        <br />
                        Mary has been an astrophotographer for about 8 years and
                        loves to photograph just about anything that is in the
                        sky! In her spare time she runs the UK Women in
                        Astronomy Network, and writes astronomy blogs and
                        articles for several online magazines and her own blog
                        page. Her astrophotographs have been featured on BBC Sky
                        at Night, BBC South Weather and a Channel 4 documentary
                        about British Weather. She has appeared in All About
                        Space Magazine, and has also had one of her photographs
                        used as the cover for a university text book. </span><br />
