              <div align="left"><span class="maintxt"> We have teamed up with
                  some leading astro-imaging figures to run a series of courses
                  which will be held at Tooley's Boatyard right by the canal in
                  Banbury.
                  <p></p>
                  These astronomy workshops are designed for the experienced as
                  well as the beginner photographer. The courses aim to inspire
                  both practicing and armchair astronomers. We will guide you
                  through what equipment is needed, how to capture and then
                  process the data. For full workshop details please click on
                  the course name below and for more information about the
                  speaker, please click on their name.
                  <p></p>
                  The course season runs from September to August.<br />
