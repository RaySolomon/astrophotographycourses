                        is worth a thousand pictures. There is a code hidden in
                        the light around us and it is revealed by spreading the
                        light into its spectrum with a spectroscope:
                        <p></p>
                        Spectroscopy was once the domain of professional
                        astronomers, but advances in the equipment and a
                        reduction in the cost are bringing it well within the
                        reach of amateurs.

                        The course assumes no previous experience or specialist
                        knowledge. It will put astronomical spectroscopy into
                        both a historic and a scientific context. It will
                        introduce some of the equipment and techniques used by
                        amateurs today, and the results that can be achieved.
                        <p></p>
                        There will be practical, hands-on demonstrations of
                        spectroscopy in action, with several case studies to
                        show how cracking the code can reveal so much about the
                        chemistry, temperature and motion:
                        <p></p>
                        The content of the course will provide some answers to
                        these questions:<br />
                        – What is the nature of the code hidden in starlight?<br />
                        – Who laid the foundations of astronomical spectroscopy?<br />
                        – How do spectroscopes work and how are spectra
                        captured?<br />
                        – Why is it interesting to examine the light in your
                        kitchen and living room?<br />
                        – What amateur equipment is out there today?<br />
                        – How is software used to process the spectrum and crack
                        the code?<br />
                        – Where can help and support be found?
                        <p></p>
                        The course aims to inspire both practicing and armchair
                        astronomers. It will be relaxed and interactive and
                        there won't be an exam at the end!<br />
